## CSS
There are a few CSS selectors that are built into the Slick component. These class names can be found by inspecting the elements.

## Text
Text for each image appears above the background image. The fontSize function looks at the text for each image object and uses the length to determine the appropriate font size. The result is pretty good for most 3- to 10-letter words. CSS does the result of the work to place the rotated text on the left of the image.
